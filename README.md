# CityPal: A Smart Pedestrian Safety Web App

CityPal is a predictive and real-time web application that identifies high-risk pedestrian zones using advanced data analytics, computer vision, and community reports. The goal is to help city officials and residents make smarter decisions about pedestrian safety infrastructure and awareness in the city of Charlotte.

## Project Overview

CityPal collects and analyzes data such as crash reports, 311 service calls, and historical injury networks to predict pedestrian safety risks. The frontend visualizes this data on an interactive map, while the backend processes the data, runs the machine learning model, and serves the risk predictions.

## Features

- Predictive pedestrian risk classification using ML  
- Interactive map with clustered and color-coded markers  
- Real-time alert system and notifications  
- "View on Map" functionality for detailed incident reports  
- YOLOv8 integration (in progress) for visual detection
