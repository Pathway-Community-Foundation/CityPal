9680025,Police,,,,COMPLAINT,N,N,COMPLAINT,"Councilman Graham received the following complaint from Mr. Dykes regarding the Bee Hive nightclub via email:

I'm writing to follow up with your office concerning the years long complaints about the Bee Hive nightclub located at 4410 Beatties Ford Road. Some progress has been made about the parking and litter, although we occasionally have issues with it...especially left behind open containers of alcohol.  

The one thing we can't seem to solve is the noise. There have been no attempts to abate the bass reverberation by the operators of that business.  My home is a considerable distance from the Bee Hive but I can hear the bass bump all night long. My question is, does the UDO help us at all with usurping the grandfathered non conforming property use law that allowed the Bee Hive to open at all? The address of the Bee Hive is zoned NB-1. And, a nightclub is not a permitted use of of a property in that zone. If the Bee Hive is considered a neighborhood commercial business, I challenge that because it does not serve the Fox Glenn neighborhood and its hours of operation suggests that it is exclusively a nightclub. Please see the screen shot of the UDO.

If the Bee Hive is still protected by grandfathering, can the numerous complaints challenge and revoke their permission to operate? 

While CMPD has responded when we call, the cat and mouse game that would produce citations continues. Sometimes the Bee Hive doesn't play the music loudly until midnight. And after waiting to see if the club operators will be at all sensitive to what they are doing and we call 911...they close at 2 a.m. When officers arrive (non emergency) they only find a few cars in the parking lot and no citation is given. 

Thank you for your attention to this issue.
